This is a midterm project for a cis111 class. 

Onjective: Create an 8 bit adder using functions that use if else logic to serve as logic gates. Inputs bits will be derived from std input. Output of the finals gates will be pushed to the std output. 

checklist: use if statements for functions, or switch statements if possible
		if using if statements use foo ? bar : baz notation for easy reading
	Every "logical" logic gate should have 2 inputs (0 or 1) return a 0 or 1
	use circuit diagrams for structure of code
